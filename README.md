# Anki Resources SDK Sample applications

This solution contains tutorial applications for the Anki Resources SDK.

## Getting Started

### Documentation

* [Anki Resources SDK Documentation](https://randym32.github.io/Anki.Resources.SDK/)


## Sample Projects

There is just two examples for now.

### Example 1 - Playing a Sound

This shows how to open the assets, list the sounds, and to play them.

### Example 2 - Playing a Sprite Sequence

This shows how to open the assets, list the sprite sequence, and to display the
frames on the screen.  This example includes some code to colourize the otherwise
grayscale PNGs (using a "ColorMatrix").  Note: set the colour to white to leave the
sprite sequences with colours alone.
